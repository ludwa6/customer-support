Let me check the use-existing-db.js script, which seems to be the script we need to run to detect and use existing Notion databases:


Opened use-existing-db.js
Now I'll check if the Notion secrets are properly configured:

Great! I've found that you already have the required Notion secrets configured (NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET and NOTION_PAGE_URL). Now, let's run the script to detect and use your existing Notion databases.

Let's run the use-existing-db.js script:


Executed node use-existing-db.js
I see the issue - the script was able to connect to your Notion page successfully, but it didn't find any databases in your Notion page. For this portal to work, you need to have databases set up in your Notion page.

Let's check the setup script, which should help create these databases for you:


Opened setup.js
Let's check the part of the setup script that runs the Notion setup:


Executed grep -n "runSetupScript" setup.js

Opened setup.js
Now let's look at the setup-notion.ts script that creates the databases:


Opened server/setup-notion.ts
Let's look for the function that sets up the databases:


Executed grep -n "setupNotionDatabases" server/setup-notion.ts

Opened server/setup-notion.ts
Now I need to check if there's a prevention setup in place that's stopping the creation of databases:


Executed ls -la | grep prevent
I'm analyzing the current situation with your Notion documentation portal setup.

Based on the available information:

✓ Found your Notion integration credentials
✓ Successfully connected to your Notion page
→ Attempting to detect existing databases

The issue appears to be that no databases were found in your Notion page. Additionally, there's a .prevent-notion-setup file that's blocking the creation of new databases.

Two options to move forward:

Remove the prevention file and let the system create new databases
Create the required databases directly in your Notion page
Would you like me to remove the prevention file and set up new databases for you?
