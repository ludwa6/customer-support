### 1. Duplicate the Notion Template

Start by duplicating our pre-configured Notion template that includes all the necessary databases:

1. Go to the template page: [Customer Support Admin TEMPLATE](https://www.notion.so/Customer-Support-Admin-TEMPLATE-1ebc922b6d5b808e827ae3f3ab4fbe43?pvs=21)
2. Click "Duplicate" in the top-right corner
3. Select the workspace where you want to save the template
4. Once duplicated, this page will contain all the required databases already structured correctly

### **2. Create a Notion Integration**

1. Go to the [Notion integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name your integration (e.g., "Customer Portal")
4. Select the workspace where you want to use it
5. Click "Submit"
6. Copy the "Internal Integration Secret"

> Important: We recommend creating a dedicated integration specifically for this project rather than reusing an existing one. This helps avoid conflicts and makes it easier to identify the correct databases during the setup process.
> 

### **Step 3: Share a Notion Page**

1. Click the "..." menu in the top right of the notion page
2. Select "Add connections"
3. Find and select your integration

### Step 4: Get OpenAI API Key (for AI Assistant capatabilieis)

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create new API key

### **Step 5: Remix Replit App (front-end)**

1. Remix this template  https://replit.com/@mannybernabe/Customer-Support-Page-with-Notion?v=1
2. Insert your new secrets: NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET, NOTION_PAGE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY

### **Step 6: Work with Agent to Configure you Databases**

1. Once the apps has been Remixed and you’ve add your secrets, prompt the agent with the below prompt to get started:

```markdown
I'd like to set up this Notion-powered documentation portal with my existing Notion page. I've already:

1. Created a Notion integration at https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Shared a Notion page with this integration
3. Added my NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET and NOTION_PAGE_URL as secrets

Please help me:
1. Detect existing databases in my Notion page
2. Configure the application to use these databases
3. Ensure the portal properly displays my Notion content
```
